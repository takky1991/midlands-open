        <h2>About Midlands Open MMA League</h2>
        <p>The Midlands Open MMA League is here to provide fighters the opportunity to safely gain competition experience in Ireland. We see ourselves as a grassroots organisation giving both future UFC Champions and those who have no intentions of pursuing the sport as a career the chance to experience the benefits of competing. We provide a Teen and Senior division as we look to cater for all ages. The league will run over 6 months with 4 fight days in Portarlington, Co. Laois.</p>
